Manuscripts
===========

Data, code, results, manuscripts, references, and PDF literature of my manuscripts. I am publishing them all public to stand for my support for reproducible research.

<br><br>

### Organization

Every directory is for a particular manuscript. Within the directory:

- `README.md`: every subdirectory includes a **README** file, explaining the manuscript and the subdirectory
- `Doc` : a directory where supporting documents are located.
- `Bibliography`: files for a reference manager software
- `Literature`: a directory for some of the most important references that inspired the manuscript.
- `Text`: Where the Microsoft Word or LaTeX files are located
- `Data`: raw data (if I am allowed to publish it publically)
- `Analysis`: where the analysis code is placed:
  + `MAIN`: is the file that executes the whole analysis
  + there will be more files in there for sure!
- `Report`: is the directory that includes the analysis reports. Often, numbered in the same order generated by `MAIN`
