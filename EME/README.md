Estimating Measurement Error
============================

This manuscript discusses evaluating measurement error using Hierarchical Linear
Models (HLM). The analysis and the discussion are done in the context of
large-scale studies where the cost of the study is a huge barrier.

> The data used for this analysis, unfortunately, cannot be published publicly.
Therefore the `Data` directory is empty. If the actual data is placed in this directory
the whole analysis should be reproducible using:

- [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) version SE-14
-
